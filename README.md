# Password-Generator 

This is a random password generator. Code is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The generator starts after the press of the generate password button and goes on to ask a list of prompts, confirms, and alerts. In the end it will generate a random password based off of the criteria the user chooses. I just made changes to the JavaScript code and put notes pertaining to said changes.
